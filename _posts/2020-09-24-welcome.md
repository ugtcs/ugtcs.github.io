Welcome back—we hope that all of you are healthy and safe! We’re all living in truly unprecedented times, facing now the prospect of a fully virtual fall semester. Despite the unique set of challenges this presents, we at UGTCS are still committed to fostering community for students interested in theoretical computer science. 

We have a lot of exciting events planned this semester, but we’re kicking off the semester with a Theory Mixer this weekend, followed by our first general meeting next week!

**Logistics**:
- Fill out the Fall 2020 interest form [here](https://forms.gle/ptakp6L5JXsiKvBYA).
- Keep following our website! This is where we post about upcoming events as well as some previous things we worked on.
  
**Upcoming Events**:
- **Theory Mixer** (5 PM PT on Sat. Aug. 29) *Come meet other undergrads, grad students, postdocs and faculty interested in CS theory!*
- **First General Meeting** (7 PM PT on Wed. Sep. 2) *Have a sneak peek at what we have planned this semester and how to get involved!*

We will email out Zoom links (and make a Slack post) on the day of the event!

Best,

Catherine, Hermish, Kevin, Robert
