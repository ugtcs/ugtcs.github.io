description: Hi! I’m Tynan, a fourth year CS student. I was once the world’s youngest person, have more arms than average, and can guess the solutions to NP-complete problems with 50% probability. In my free time I can be found mountain biking, untangling qubits, playing cello, and replacing the tape in my Turing machine.
