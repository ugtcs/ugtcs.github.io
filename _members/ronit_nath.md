description: Class of 2024 CS & MCB, I'm going to retain extra-Earth-terrestrial residence for 300 years. At 301, I'm going to yeet myself towards Proxima B, and see how far I get. Alternatively, if I can interstellar myself, that's also a valid path. Multiple technical problem arise when pursuing any of these, which I also intend to solve.
