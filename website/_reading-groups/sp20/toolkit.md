A Theorist’s Toolkit showcases fundamental proof techniques used in theoretical computer science
research, from spectral graph theory to quantum computing. In particular, the reading group
will highlights essential probabilistic, algebraic, combinatorial, and algorithmic methods and their
applications. The outline is inspired by, and closely follows, courses of the same name offered by
Sanjeev Arora and Ryan O’Donnell.
