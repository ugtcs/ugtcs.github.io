### About this Group

Modern algorithm design and analysis often samples techniques from a common toolbox of analytic techniques. These may include using concentration inequalities to bound error probabilities or using linear programming to relax intractable problems. This reading group, adapted from courses of similar names (see links below), will provide a tapas style introduction to these tools. Our goal will be to cover argument styles and constructions from a diverse set of mathematical studies. Building off of tools and ideas from CS70 and CS170, we will discuss topics in linear algebra, probability theory, optimization, convex geometry, information theory, and more as well as a examples of each that demonstrate their applicability towards solving a variety of combinatorial problems. Some include:

*   Analyzing hash functions and error correcting codes as sets of linear equations
*   Modeling random walks using electrical networks
*   Using entropy to demonstrate that certain subgraphs exist

The examples we encounter along the way will be rigorous yet succinct, and hopefully reveal connections between various problems that one might not have expected!
