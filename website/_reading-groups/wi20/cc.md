This reading group will focus on studying [Computability and Complexity](http://hjemmesider.diku.dk/~neil/comp2book2007/book-whole.pdf) by Neil D. Jones. 

The book we are using focus on the fundamental theory of computability, decidability, and complexity. 
There will be one assignment and one report each week to help understand the reading, and they are all optional. 
Please see our syllabus for more info.

This book has two parts. The first part is computability theory and the second part is complexity theory.
