title: "Beyond Worst Case Analysis has Started!"
author: Antares Chen
---

The fall 2018 UGTCS Beyond Worst Case Analysis reading group is now in full swing!

In this week's meeting, we discussed how the expected max clique size in a random $$\mathcal{G}_{n,p}$$ graph is close to $$ 2\log(n) $$with high probability. 

BWCA is a reading group that analyzes where worst-case analysis fails and provides more refined methods for analysis of algorithms. 
We cover topics such as average-case analysis for random instances, analysis of distributions with planted solutions, semi-random models, instance stability, and analysis of online algorithms.

We meet every week Monday 5:30 - 7:00pm and occasionally hold special group events to work on topic related exercises and programming tasks. 
If you're interested, please check out [the BWCA home page](/reading-groups/fa18/bwca/) for more information. 
Next week we will be discussing the AKS algorithm for finding a planted clique of size $$\sqrt{n}$$ in a random $$\mathcal{G}_{n,1/2}$$ graph. 
We hope to see you there!
