Hi everyone, welcome back! I hope your semester has started off well.
We’ll be having our first general meeting on Monday, February 3 at 7pm
in Soda 380. 

Come eat free food and listen to us announce our two
reading groups for the semester as well as some smaller groups that
allow you to meet people and either do some theory research or focus
on a topic you’re more interested in.
